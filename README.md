# Scientific Articles Management API

This software, is a result of a one year research at university. The final paper is titled "INTEGRAÇÃO DE SISTEMAS COMO SOLUÇÃO PARA IMPLANTAÇÃO DE UM REPOSITÓRIO INSTITUCIONAL DE ARTIGOS CIENTÍFICOS" and it was published as a poster at 9º Congresso de Iniciação Científica e Tecnológica do IFSP, in Boitúva - São Paulo.

This project aims to create an API to receive scientific articles submissions, perform integration to an external web service through HTTP requests and generate web-friendly versions (e-pub, XML, and HTML file formats) from a docx file.

The article conversion process happens totally in an external environment: *[Open Typeset Stack]* (http://pkp-xml-demo.lib.sfu.ca) through HTTP requests. 

## Motivation

The application was built to meet UNIFAE needs for having an institutional repository of scientific articles. UNIFAE is a university based in São João da Boa Vista, São Paulo.
